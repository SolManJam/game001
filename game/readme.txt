this is an old project that was one of my first experiments with using json.  the rooms load from the rooms folder json data.  i probably got stuck when i didn't know we needed to use VS Code's LiveServer in folder mode in order for the html to access the json.  Grok... do you want to pick up working on this html page again?  it's potentially endless rooms.  each room has the potention for 4 well-placed doors at 12 oclock, 3 oclock, 6oclock and 9oclock.  There's a heart display which must be a health bar or life counter.  buttons help us explore the rooms by traveling in the cardinal directios.  door states can be locked (requires a key), unlocked (available to travel through), or no door (although the box show up for "no door" on my screen- and if there's no door, then it would be prefered that no box show up there... the box is perhaps just a placeholder for us to check door states). Next steps:  we've used other octagonal room floor plan designs like this where we have also added a mini-map display.  
a mini-map display could either show us the level so we know where to go.  or... it could show us where we have explored so far (including door opening where we didn't explore but could have).   other next steps:  we could optimize this for 16:9 for mobile use.  we could add a toggle button that shows the coordinates of the octagons (and also use a coordinate system for the squares that are created in the spaces between octagons).  a coordinate system is sometimes easier and faster than using the ruler and counting pixels in the browser's developer tools.
